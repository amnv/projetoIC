About 85% of the cell population in this bone tissue are osteocytes and the remainder are osteoblasts, bone marrow, etc."
After informed consent, bone marrow specimens packed with leukemic blasts were obtained in each patient.

In conclusion, a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line was developed, which can be used for basic studies of mesenchymal cells and to functionally study transgenes that might play a role in oncogenic transformation."
In this paper, the generation and characterization of a TERT-immortalized, non-tumorigenic human bone marrow-derived stromal mesenchymal model cell line is described.
"In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation characteristics of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) form different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT ), umbilical cord (UC) as well as dermal fibroblasts by using the HumanMethylation450K array.
In this study we have reprogrammed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from human bone marrow by retrovirus-mediated overexpression of OCT-3/4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4.

"We examined DNA methylation and RNA expression status during early B-cell development by sorting multiple replicates of four separate stages of pre-B cells derived from normal human fetal bone marrow and applied high-dimension DNA methylation scanning and expression arrays."
We here describe the pattern of gene expression, histone modification and DNA binding of the bone master regulator RUNX2 during osteogenic differentiation of an immortalized human bone marrow-derived MSC cell line.
We reprogrammed bone marrow MSCs into iPSCs which were subsequently re-differentiated towards MSCs.
