"The methylation analysis of HPV+ HNSCC cell lines and HPV- HNSCC cell lines as well as clones from an infected HPV- cell line by Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip"
"Non-CG methylation is an unexplored epigenetic hallmark of pluripotent stem cells.  Here we report that a reduction in non-CG methylation is associated with impaired differentiation capacity into endodermal lineages. Genome-wide analysis of 2,670 non-CG sites in a discovery cohort of 25 phenotyped human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines revealed unidirectional loss (Δβ = 13%, p<7.4x10-4) of non-CG methylation that correctly identifies endodermal differentiation capacity in 23 out of 25 (92%) hiPSC lines.  Translation into a simplified assay of only 9 non-CG sites maintains predictive power in the discovery cohort (Δβ = 23%, p<9.1x10-6) and correctly identifies endodermal differentiation capacity in nince out of ten pluripotent stem cell lines in an independent replication cohort consisting of hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types and different delivery systems, as well as human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines.  This finding infers non-CG methylation at these sites as a biomarker when assessing endodermal differentiation capacity as a readout."
"Human pluripotent stem cells hold great potential for regenerative medicine, but existing cell types have imitations. Human embryonic stem cells derived from fertilized embryos (IVF-ESCs) are considered the “gold standard”, but are allogeneic to potential recipients. Autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from somatic cells by forced expression of pluripotency-associated factors, but are prone to genetic and epigenetic aberrations. To determine whether accumulation of such aberrations is intrinsic to somatic cell reprogramming, or secondary to the reprogramming method, we employed an alternative approach by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). SCNT-based reprogramming to NT-ESCs is mediated by factors present in oocyte’s cytoplasm, thus mimicking early embryogenesis. We generated genetically matched pluripotent stem cells and conducted genome-wide genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional analyses. We discovered that unlike iPSCs, NT-ESCs have a low burden of de novo copy number variations (CNVs), reflecting superior maintenance of genetic stability. Moreover, DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of NT-ESCs corresponded closely to those of IVF-ESCs. In contrast, iPSCs harbored methylation abnormalities including residual CpG methylation typical of parental fibroblasts, suggesting incomplete reprogramming. We conclude that human somatic cells can be faithfully reprogrammed to pluripotency by SCNT with the potential to satisfy the clinical requirements for cell replacement therapies."

"We compared the gene methylation profile of 26 breast cancer cell lines to identify variations associated with different phenotypes and molecular subtype. The panel includes 13 estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and 13 ER+ cell lines. Four of the ER- cell lines and 5 of the ER+ cell lines are HER2 positive."
"Human pluripotent stem cells can be derived from somatic cells by forced expression of defined factors, and more recently by nuclear-transfer into human oocytes, revitalizing a debate on whether one reprogramming approach might be advantageous over the other. Here we compared the genetic and epigenetic stability of human nuclear-transfer embryonic stem cell (NT-ESC) lines and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, derived from the same somatic cell cultures of fetal, neonatal and adult origin. Both cell types shared similar genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. Importantly, NT-ESCs and iPSCs have comparable numbers of de novo coding mutations but significantly higher than parthenogenetic ESCs. Similar to iPSCs NT-ESCs displayed clone- and gene-specific aberrations in DNA methylation and allele-specific expression of imprinted genes, similarly to iPSCs. The occurrence of these genetic and epigenetic defects in both NT-ESCs and iPSCs suggests that they are inherent to reprogramming, regardless of the underlying technique."
"Background: Germ Cell Cancers (GCC), originating from Primordial Germ Cells /gonocytes, are the most common cancer in young men, subdivided in seminoma (SE) and non-seminoma (NS, stem cell component: embryonal carcinoma (EC)). Somatic mutations are rarely found in GCC. It has been proposed that disruption of the epigenetic constitution, either primarily or secondary (e.g. environmental influences), is involved in cancer, and specifically in GCC."

"Analysis of contribution of cell type of origin and individual to gene expression differences in iPSCs. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that cell type of origin affects iPSC gene expression. Results show that individual has a much stronger effect than cell type of origin on differences between iPSCs derived from multiple individuals."
"The study includes 101 individuals, 50 young and 51 old, no replicates. From each individual there are CD4 and CD8 T-cell and peripheral blood samples extracted. The total number of samples is 296, of which 99 have CD4 T -cell, 100 have CD8 T-cell and 97 have peripheral blood data."
"CD34+ cells were isolated from fresh umbilical cord blood after written consent according to the guidelines specifically approved by the Ethic Committee of RWTH Aachen University (Permit Number: EK187/08) using  the CD34 Micro Bead Kit on a MiniMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Cells were cultured in StemSpan serum free expansion medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Grenoble, France) supplemented with 10 µg/mL heparin (ratiopharm, GmbH, Ulm, Germany), 20 ng/mL thrombopoietin (TPO; PeproTech GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), 10 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF; PeproTech), 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1; PeproTech). Culture was either performed on tissue culture plastic (TCP) or on a confluent layer of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs; passage 3 to 6). After seven days, CD34+ and CD34- fractions were again separated as described above."

"Here, we determined the DNA methylation profiles of 12 human cell lines, including 2 ESC lines, 2 pESC lines,4 virally-delivered iPSC lines, 2 episomal-delivered iPSC lines, and 2 parent cell lines that iPSCs derived from using Illumina’s Infinium HumanMethylation450. The iPSCs exhibited a hypermethylation status similarly to ESCs but distinct differences from the parent cells. Genes of common methylation pattern between iPSCs and ESCs were regarded as critical factors for stemness, while differences existing between iPSCs and ESCs implied that iPSCs partly retained the parental characteristics and gained de novo methylation aberrances during cell reprogramming. No significant variant was identified between virally- and episomal- systems. De novo differentiated methylation regions as the signature of particular stem cell lines were figured out in detail in this study."

"In differentiated cells, aging is associated with hypermethylation of DNA regions enriched in repressive histone posttranslational modifications. However, the chromatin marks associated with changes in DNA methylation in adult stem cells during lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, DNA methylation profiling of mesenchymal stem cells obtained from individuals aged 2 to 92 identified 18735 hypermethylated and 45407 hypomethylated CpG sites associated with aging. As in differentiated cells, hypermethylated sequences were enriched in chromatin repressive marks. Most importantly, hypomethylated CpG sites were strongly enriched in the active chromatin mark H3K4me1 in stem and differentiated cells, suggesting this is a cell type-independent chromatin signature of DNA hypomethylation during aging. Analysis of scedasticity showed that interindividual variability of DNA methylation increased during aging in MSCs and differentiated cells, providing a new avenue for the identification of DNA methylation changes over time. DNA methylation profiling of genetically identical individuals showed that both the tendency of DNA methylation changes and scedasticity depended on non-genetic as well as genetic factors. Our results indicate that the dynamics of DNA methylation during aging depend on a complex mixture of factors that include the DNA sequence, cell type and chromatin context involved, and that, depending on the locus, the changes can be modulated by genetic and/or external factors."

"The variation among induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in their differentiation capacity to specific lineages is frequently attributed to somatic memory. In this study, we compared hematopoietic differentiation capacity of 35 human iPSC lines derived from four different tissues and four embryonic stem cell lines. The analysis revealed that hematopoietic commitment capacity (PSCs to hematopoietic precursors) is correlated with the expression level of the IGF2 gene independent of the iPSC origins. In contrast, maturation capacity (hematopoietic precursors to mature blood) is affected by iPSC origin; blood-derived iPSCs showed the highest capacity. However, some fibroblast-derived iPSCs showed higher capacity than blood-derived clones. Tracking of DNA methylation changes during reprogramming reveals that maturation capacity is highly associated with aberrant DNA methylation acquired during reprogramming, rather than the types of iPSC origins. These data demonstrated that variations in the hematopoietic differentiation capacity of iPSCs are not attributable to somatic memories of their origins."

"Conclusion: The overall similarity between TCam-2 / NCCIT supports an erased embryonic gem cell arrested in early gonadal development as common origin. Subtle difference in the (integrated) epigenetic and expression profiles indicated TCam-2 to exhibit a more germ cell like profile (enrichment Androgen regulation) while NCCIT proved more pluripotent. The results provide insight into an integrated analysis of the functional genome in GCC cell lines."
"""Epigenetic and in vivo comparison of diverse mesenchymal stromal cell sources reveals an endochonrdal signature for human hematopoietic niche formation """
"""Public on Apr 30 2014"""
"""Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."""
"""MSCs from BM, WAT, UC and skin were isolated using plastic adherence. Cells were expanded in standard alpha-MEM supplemented with pooled human platelet lysate fully replacing fetal bovine serum. MSCs were subcutaneously implanted into immune-compromised mice to comparatively evaluate bone formation and subsequent bone marrow attraction. In parallel we have isolated RNA from all sources to analyze tissue source specific gene expression profile."""

"T cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ CD4- CD8- double negative T cells represent a rare T cell subset implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the DNA methylation signature of double negative T cells to gain insight into the epigenetic architecture and transcriptional capacity of peripheral blood primary human double negative T cells compared to autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  We identified 2,984 CG sites across the genome with unique loss of DNA methylation in double negative T cells, and showed significant reduction in mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNA methylation was increased in CD8A/CD8B and CD4 consistent with epigenetic repression of both the CD8 and CD4 genetic loci in double negative T cells. Curiously, we show consistent increase in non-CG methylation in double negative T cells, a finding suggestive of pluripotency and previously only known to occur in embryonic stem cells and developing brain tissue. Network analyses of genes hypomethylated in double negative compared to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells indicate a strong relationship between double negative T cells and functions related to cell-cell interaction, cell adhesion, and cell activation pathways. Our data also suggest a robust pro-inflammatory epigenetic signature in double negative T cells, consistent with a transcriptional permissiveness to produce key inflammatory cytokines including IFNγ, IL-17F, IL-12B, IL-5, IL-18, TNFSF11 (RANKL), and TNFSF13B (BLYS or BAFF). These findings highlight an epigenetic basis for a role of double negative T cells in autoimmunity and extend the potential pathogenic transcriptional capacity of this unique T cell subset."

"We have previously described gene expression changes during spontaneous immortalization of T cells, thereby identifying cellular processes important for cell growth crisis escape and long term proliferation. Here we analyze the same model to investigate the role of genome-wide methylation in the immortalization process at different time points pre- and post- crisis using high-resolution arrays. We show that over time in culture there is an overall accumulation of methylation alterations, with  preferential increased methylation close to transcription start sites, island and shore regions.  Interestingly, the pattern of CpG site methylation observed in post-crisis T-cell cultures was similar to clinical T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples classified as CpG island methylator phenotype positive (CIMP+). These sites were highly overrepresented by polycomb target genes and involved in developmental, cell adhesion and cell signaling processes. The presence of nonrandom methylation events in in vitro immortalized T-cell cultures and diagnostic T-ALL samples indicates altered methylation of CpG sites with a possible role in malignant hematopoiesis."
"Cellular heterogeneity may bias cell type specific epigenetic patterns leading to a dramatic increase in false positive or negative findings in psychiatric epigenetic studies. To address this issue, we performed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of neuronal nuclei in post mortem frontal cortex 58 samples followed by Illumina HM450 microarray based DNA methylation profiling. We characterized the extent of neuron and glia specific DNA methylation variation independent of disease status and identified significant cell type specific epigenetic variation at 51% of loci."
"The mechanisms underlying human NK cell phenotypic and functional heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we describe the emergence of diverse subsets of human NK cells selectively lacking expression of signaling proteins following cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The absence of B and myeloid cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Intriguingly, geneome-wide analyses revealed patterns of DNA methylation that were strikingly similar between CMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells, but differed from those of canonical NK cells."
"Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of human PC3 invasive prostate cancer cell line treated with vehicle control (SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine) and with SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) as well as of untreated human LNCaP non-invasive prostate cancer cell line. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA Methylation BeadChip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in human cell lines exposed to described treatments. Samples included biological triplicate of PC3 control (SAH treated), biological triplicate of PC3 treated with SAM, and biological duplicate of LNCaP untreated."
"Results: This study aims at identifying epigenetic footprints of SE and EC cell lines in genome-wide profiles by studying the interaction between gene expression, DNA CpG methylation and histone modifications, and their function in GCC and related disruption of germ cell maturation. Two well characterized GCC-derived cell lines were compared, one representative for SE (TCam-2) and the other for EC (NCCIT). Data was acquired using the Illumina HumanHT-12-v4 (gene expression) and HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (methylation) microarrays as well as ChIP sequencing (activating histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac)). The data show that known germ cell markers are not only present and differentiating between SE and NS at the expression level, but also in the epigenetic landscape."

"Pluripotent stem cells evade replicative senescence, whereas other primary cells lose their proliferation and differentiation potential after a limited number of cell divisions – and this is accompanied by specific senescence-associated DNA methylation (SA-DNAm) changes. Here, we investigate SA-DNAm changes in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) upon long-term culture, irradiation-induced senescence, immortalization and reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using high density HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. SA-DNAm changes are highly reproducible and occur particularly in intergenic and non-promoter regions of developmental genes. We demonstrate that ionizing irradiation, although associated with a very similar senescence phenotype, does not affect SA-DNAm. Furthermore, overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the human telomerase (TERT) or conditional immortalization with a doxycycline-inducible system (TERT and SV40 TAg) result in telomere extension but do not influence SA-DNAm. In contrast, we demonstrate that reprogramming into iPSC prevented SA-DNAm changes. Our results indicate that replicative senescence is associated with an epigenetically controlled process which stalls cells in a particular differentiated state, whereas irradiation-induced senescence and immortalization are not causally related to this process. Absence of SA-DNAm in pluripotent cells may play a central role for their escape from cellular senescence. "
"RESULTS: We show that patterns of methylation divide NSCLCs into EL and ML subsets as defined by gene expression and that these signatures are similarly correlated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors. We identify multiple DMRs, including ERBB2 and ZEB2, whose methylation status is strongly associated with an epithelial phenotype in NSCLC cell lines, surgically resected tumors, and formalin-fixed biopsies from NSCLC patients who went on to fail front-line chemotherapy."

"To analysis of the effect of HOTAIR on global DNA methylation in KYSE180 esophageal cancer cell line, genome-scale DNA methylation was analyzed in a pair of esophageal cancer cell lines, KYSE180 cells stably transfected with HOTAIR and control KYSE180 cells. The results from genome-wide DNA methylation analysis indicate that hypermethylation occurs more frequently than hypomethylation after stably ectopic expressing HOTAIR in KYSE180 cells."

"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a valuable resource for discovery of epigenetic changes critical to cell type-specific differentiation. Although iPS cells have been generated from other terminally differentiated cells, the reprogramming of normal adult human basal prostatic epithelial (E-PZ) cells to a pluripotent state has not been reported.  Here, we attempted to reprogram E-PZ cells by forced expression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 using lentiviral vectors and obtained embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like colonies at a frequency of 0.01%.  These E-PZ-iPS-like cells with normal karyotype gained expression of pluripotent genes typical of iPS cells (Tra-1-81, SSEA-3, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4) and lost gene expression characteristic of basal prostatic epithelial cells (CK5, CK14, and p63).  E-PZ-iPS-like cells demonstrated pluripotency by differentiating into ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal cells in vitro, although lack of teratoma formation in vivo and incomplete demethylation of pluripotency genes suggested only partial reprogramming.  Importantly, E-PZ-iPS-like cells re-expressed basal epithelial cell markers (CD44, p63, MAO-A) in response to prostate-specific medium in spheroid culture.  Androgen induced expression of androgen receptor (AR), and co-culture with rat urogenital sinus further induced expression of prostate-specific antigen, a hallmark of secretory cells, suggesting that E-PZ-iPS-like cells have the capacity to differentiate into prostatic basal and secretory epithelial cells.  Finally, when injected into mice, E-PZ-iPS-like cells expressed basal epithelial cell markers including CD44 and p63.  When co-injected with rat urogenital mesenchyme, E-PZ-iPS-like cells expressed AR and expression of p63 and CD44 was repressed. DNA methylation profiling identified key pathways and regulators of prostatic differentiation including Wnt5a, BPM7, PTEN, and NKx3.1 using E-PZ-iPS-lke cells. Our results suggest that iPS-like cells can be derived from prostatic epithelial cells.  These cells are pluripotent and capable of prostatic differentiation, and therefore provide a novel model for investigating epigenetic changes involved in prostate cell lineage specification."
"We monitored 9 pluripotent stem cell lines across three time points of hepatic directed differentiation, representing 3 developmental stages: undifferentiated (T0), definitive endoderm (T5), and early hepatocyte (T24). ESCs (n=3) and patient-derived normal (n=3) or PiZZ (n=3) iPSCs were analyzed in the undifferentiated state (T0), after differentiation to definitive endoderm (T5), and upon reaching hepatic stage (T24) for a total of 27 samples.  We sought to test the hypothesis that a single transgene-free iPSC clone from each donor could be used to detect disease-specific differences between the normal cohort and the PiZZ cohort, anticipating that this difference would emerge only at a developmental stage in which the mutant AAT gene is expressed. Cells were sorted before analysis at T0 and T5 after antibody staining for TRA1-80+/SSEA3+ (T0) or C-kit+/CXCR4+ (T5) cells."
"We first demonstrate that non-genetically determined inter-individual differentially methylated regions (iiDMRs) can be temporally stable for at least two years. Then, we show that iiDMRS are associated with concomitant changes in chromatin state as measured by inter-individual differences in the levels of the histone variant H2A.Z. However, the correlation of promoter iiDMRs with gene expression is negligible and this correlation is not improved even by integrating H2A.Z information. We find that most promoter epialleles, whether genetically or non-genetically determined, are associated with low levels of transcriptional activity, depleted for house keeping genes, and either depleted for H3K4me3/enriched for H3K27me3, or lacking both these marks in human embryonic stem cells. These findings validate in an independent cohort. Interestingly, the key features of iiDMRs are reminiscent of those previously observed for promoters that undergo hyper-methylation in various cancers, in vitro cell culture, and human chronological ageing."

"A variety of somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but the small number of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) present in non-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) would be a convenient and desirable starting target. We report here a simple method for targeting derivation of iPSC from non-mobilized PB CD34+ HSCs using immunobead purification and 2-4 day culture to achieve enrichment of CD34+ HSCs to 80±9%, followed by reprogramming transduction with loxP-flanked polycistronic (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc) STEMCCA-loxP lentivector at an MOI of 2. Our yield was 4.7±2.2 iPSC colonies (n=12) per 20 mL non-mobilized peripheral blood, where most colonies had single copy STEMCCA-loxP that was easily excised by transient transfection expression of Cre. Resultant iPSC clones expressed pluripotent cell markers, had genomic methylation pattern closely matching embryonic stem cells, and generated teratomas containing tissues of all three germ lineages in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, we conclude that these iPSC are derived from the non-mobilized CD34+ HSCs enriched from PB rather than from any lymphocyte or monocyte contaminants because they lacked somatic rearrangements typical of T or B lymphocytes, and because we demonstrated that purified CD14+ monocytes do not yield iPSC colonies under these reprogramming conditions."
"Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and trisomic placentas, and maternal blood cell DNA. The aim of this study was to search for methylation differences between maternal and fetal(placenta) cell free DNA, and between normal and trisomic placentas for an optimized methylation based noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aberations.   The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in DNA samples from Chorionic villus samples(CVS)  and DNA samples from whole blood.

"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from fresh blood samples of 7 unrelated healthy women (age range 25-60) (Supplementary Table 1) by Ficoll-gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Subsequently, T cells were negatively-selected using the Human Pan T Cell Isolation II kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cambridge, MA). T cells were then analyzed and sorted into TCRαβ+ CD4+ T cells, TCRαβ+ CD8+ T cells, and TCRαβ+ DN T cell subsets by flow cytometry. DNA was isolated from CD4+, CD8+, and DN T cell subsets using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), then bisulfite-converted using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) for DNA methylation studies."
"Standardization of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains a major obstacle in regenerative medicine. Starting material and culture expansion affect cell preparations and render comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) assimilate towards a ground-state and may therefore give rise to more standardized cell preparations. We reprogrammed bone marrow MSCs into iPSCs which were subsequently re-differentiated towards MSCs. These iPS-MSCs revealed similar morphology, immunophenotype, in vitro differentiation potential, and gene expression profiles as primary MSCs. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of iPSCs maintained some donor-specific characteristics, whereas tissue-specific, senescence-associated, and age-related DNAm patterns were erased during reprogramming. iPS-MSCs reacquired senescence-associated DNAm during culture expansion but they remained rejuvenated with regard to age-related DNAm. Overall, iPS-MSCs and MSCs are similar in function but differ in their epigenetic makeup."
"Comparative studies in primates are extremely restricted because we only have access to a few types of cell lines from non-human apes and to a limited collection of frozen tissues. In order to gain better insight into regulatory processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of tissues and cell types. To facilitate this, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from fibroblasts of healthy donors. All lines are free of integration from exogenous reprogramming vectors, can be maintained using standard iPSC culture techniques, and have proliferative and differentiation potential similar to human and mouse lines. To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-seq data and methylation profiles from the chimpanzee iPSCs and their corresponding fibroblast precursors, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their precursors, which were of multiple cell type and population origins. Overall, we observed much less regulatory variation within species in the iPSCs than in the somatic precursors, indicating that the reprogramming process has erased many of the differences observed between somatic cells of different origins. We identified 4,918 differentially expressed genes and 1,986 differentially methylated regions between iPSCs of the two species, many of which are novel inter-species differences and not observed between the somatic cells of the two species. Our panel will help realise the potential of iPSCs, and in combination with genomic technologies, transform studies of comparative evolution in primates."
"Human ageing affects the immune system resulting in an overall decline in immunocompetence. Although all immune cells are affected during aging, the functional capacity of T cells is most influenced and is linked to decreased responsiveness to infections and impaired differentiation. We studied age-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from younger and older individuals. We observed marked difference between T cell subsets, with increased number of methylation changes and higher methylome variation in CD8+ T cells with age. The majority of age-related hypermethylated sites were located at CpG islands of silent genes and enriched for repressive histone marks. Specifically, in CD8+ T cell subset we identified strong inverse correlation between methylation and expression levels in genes associated with T cell mediated immune response (LGALS1, IFNG, CCL5, GZMH, CCR7, CD27 and CD248) and differentiation (SATB1, TCF7, BCL11B and RUNX3). Our results thus suggest the link between age-related epigenetic changes and impaired T cell function."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in world wide. During tumorigenesis, tumor suppressor and cancer-related genes are commonly silenced by aberrant DNA methylation in their promoter regions. Zebularine [1-(β-ᴅ-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one] acts as an inhibitor of DNA methylation and exhibits chemical stability and minimal cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explore the effect and possible mechanism of action of zebularine on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Here, we demonstrated that zebularine exhibited antitumor activity on HepG2 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Zebularine treatment down-regulated CDK2 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB), and up-regulated p21WAF/CIP1 and p53. We also found that zebularine treatment up-regulated phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK. These results suggest that p44/42 MAPK pathway play a role in zebularine induced cell cycle arrest by regulating activity of p21WAF/CIP1 and Rb. Furthermore, we found that zebularine induced apoptosis. Although proapoptotic protein Bax levels were not affected, antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 level was down-regulated with zebularine treatment. The data in the present study suggest that the action of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is involved in inducing apoptosis with zebularine. These results provide a novel mechanism of zebularine-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma."
"Human fetal bone marrow was obtained, and using flow cytometry antibodies, four populations of B-cell developmental stages including stage 1 (S1; predominantly multipotent progenitors before lineage commitment and common lymphoid progenitors), stage II (S2; pre-B-I cells), stage 3 (S3; pre-B-II cells) and stage 4 cells (S4; immature B cells). For 8 indibiduals, DNAs and RNAs were isolated and the methylation and expression changes during early B-cell development were identified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip (Illumina) and GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix)."
