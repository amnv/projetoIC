"DNA methylation has been considered to play an important role in myogenic differentiation. In terminal differentiation of myoblasts, a chronological pattern of DNA methylation changes has been poorly understood. Using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we obtained and evaluated the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human myoblast differentiation in vitro."
