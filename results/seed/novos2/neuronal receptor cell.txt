"We applied Illumina Human Methylation450K array to perform a genomic-scale single-site resolution DNA methylation analysis in neuronal and nonneuronal (primarily glial) nuclei separated from the orbitofrontal cortex of postmortem human brain. The findings were validated using enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We identified thousands of sites differentially methylated (DM) between neuronal and nonneuronal cells. The DM sites were depleted within CpG island–containing promoters but enriched in predicted enhancers. Classification of the DM sites into those undermethylated in neurons (neuronal type) and those undermethylated in nonneuronal cells (glial type), combined with findings of others that methylation within control elements typically negatively correlates with gene expression, yielded large sets of predicted neuron-specific and non– neuron-specific genes. These sets of predicted genes were in excellent agreement with the available direct measurements of gene expression in human and mouse. We also found a distinct set of DNA methylation patterns that were unique for neuronal cells. In particular, neuronal-type differential methylation was overrepresented in CpG island shores, enriched within gene bodies but not in intergenic regions, and preferentially harbored binding motifs for a distinct set of transcription factors, including neuron-specific activity-dependent factors. Finally, non-CpG methylation was substantially more prevalent in neurons than in nonneuronal cells."

"Cellular heterogeneity may bias cell type specific epigenetic patterns leading to a dramatic increase in false positive or negative findings in psychiatric epigenetic studies. To address this issue, we performed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of neuronal nuclei in post mortem frontal cortex 58 samples followed by Illumina HM450 microarray based DNA methylation profiling. We characterized the extent of neuron and glia specific DNA methylation variation independent of disease status and identified significant cell type specific epigenetic variation at 51% of loci."

"PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) comprise multiple distinct biological groups with different prognoses. For example, patients with epithelial-like (EL) tumors have a better prognosis and exhibit greater sensitivity to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway than patients with mesenchymal-like (ML) tumors. Here we test the hypothesis that EL NSCLCs can be distinguished from ML NSCLCs on the basis of global DNA methylation patterns."
"Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of estrogene receptor negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, treating atmospheric cold plasma (plasma). The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450k Bead chip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. This profiling indicates that plasma induces epigenetic and cellular changes."
"Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of estrogene receptor postive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, treating atmospheric cold plasma (plasma). The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450k Bead chip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. This profiling indicates that plasma induces epigenetic and cellular changes."

"Analysis of contribution of cell type of origin and individual to gene expression differences in iPSCs. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that cell type of origin affects iPSC gene expression. Results show that individual has a much stronger effect than cell type of origin on differences between iPSCs derived from multiple individuals."
"The study includes 101 individuals, 50 young and 51 old, no replicates. From each individual there are CD4 and CD8 T-cell and peripheral blood samples extracted. The total number of samples is 296, of which 99 have CD4 T -cell, 100 have CD8 T-cell and 97 have peripheral blood data."

"T cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ CD4- CD8- double negative T cells represent a rare T cell subset implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the DNA methylation signature of double negative T cells to gain insight into the epigenetic architecture and transcriptional capacity of peripheral blood primary human double negative T cells compared to autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  We identified 2,984 CG sites across the genome with unique loss of DNA methylation in double negative T cells, and showed significant reduction in mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNA methylation was increased in CD8A/CD8B and CD4 consistent with epigenetic repression of both the CD8 and CD4 genetic loci in double negative T cells. Curiously, we show consistent increase in non-CG methylation in double negative T cells, a finding suggestive of pluripotency and previously only known to occur in embryonic stem cells and developing brain tissue. Network analyses of genes hypomethylated in double negative compared to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells indicate a strong relationship between double negative T cells and functions related to cell-cell interaction, cell adhesion, and cell activation pathways. Our data also suggest a robust pro-inflammatory epigenetic signature in double negative T cells, consistent with a transcriptional permissiveness to produce key inflammatory cytokines including IFNγ, IL-17F, IL-12B, IL-5, IL-18, TNFSF11 (RANKL), and TNFSF13B (BLYS or BAFF). These findings highlight an epigenetic basis for a role of double negative T cells in autoimmunity and extend the potential pathogenic transcriptional capacity of this unique T cell subset."

"Conclusion: The overall similarity between TCam-2 / NCCIT supports an erased embryonic gem cell arrested in early gonadal development as common origin. Subtle difference in the (integrated) epigenetic and expression profiles indicated TCam-2 to exhibit a more germ cell like profile (enrichment Androgen regulation) while NCCIT proved more pluripotent. The results provide insight into an integrated analysis of the functional genome in GCC cell lines."
"Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) is a transcriptional coregulator that has been associated with early development of many systems such as neuronal, muscular, cardiovascular and urogenital. The present study aimed to explore the genome-wide effects of MAML1 on gene expression and DNA methylation in human embryonic kidney cells. RNA expression was measured using a microarray that screens approximately 36,000 transcripts, and DNA methylation was determined for 450,000 CpG sites. 225 genes were found to be differentially expressed, while 11802 CpG sites were found to be differentially methylated in MAML1-expressing cells. A subset of 211 differentially methylated loci was associated with the expression of 85 genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes are involved in the regulation of urogenital system development, cell adhesion and embryogenesis."

"We have previously described gene expression changes during spontaneous immortalization of T cells, thereby identifying cellular processes important for cell growth crisis escape and long term proliferation. Here we analyze the same model to investigate the role of genome-wide methylation in the immortalization process at different time points pre- and post- crisis using high-resolution arrays. We show that over time in culture there is an overall accumulation of methylation alterations, with  preferential increased methylation close to transcription start sites, island and shore regions.  Interestingly, the pattern of CpG site methylation observed in post-crisis T-cell cultures was similar to clinical T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples classified as CpG island methylator phenotype positive (CIMP+). These sites were highly overrepresented by polycomb target genes and involved in developmental, cell adhesion and cell signaling processes. The presence of nonrandom methylation events in in vitro immortalized T-cell cultures and diagnostic T-ALL samples indicates altered methylation of CpG sites with a possible role in malignant hematopoiesis."
"Regulatory T cells (Treg) prevent the emergence of autoimmune disease. Prototypic natural Treg (nTreg) are programmed by Forkhead-box P3 (FOXP3) and can be reliably identified by demethylation at the FOXP3 locus. To explore the nTreg methylation landscape we performed genome-wide methylation studies on human naïve resting nTreg (rTreg) and conventional naïve CD4+ T cells (Naïve). We detected 2,315 differentially methylated CpGs between these two cell types, many of which clustered into 127 regions of differential methylation (RDMs). T cell activation induced changes in 466 individual CpGs and 18 RDMs in naïve CD4+ T cells, but did not alter DNA methylation in rTreg. Expression of mRNA for TIGIT, an immune suppressive receptor demethylated in rTreg, was upregulated in nTreg and reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals at risk for autoimmune (type 1) diabetes.  Gene-set testing of the 127 RDMs revealed enrichment of common Treg signature genes, FOXP3 bound genes and genes directly upregulated by FOXP3, which was primarily driven by the subset of demethylated RDMs. A putative Forkhead-binding motif overrepresented in promoter-associated RDMs suggests methylation regulates gene expression by influencing FOXP3 binding. Our findings provide new insights into epigenetic regulation of human nTreg and the potential to exploit differential methylation as an immune biomarker in human diseases."
"The mechanisms underlying human NK cell phenotypic and functional heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we describe the emergence of diverse subsets of human NK cells selectively lacking expression of signaling proteins following cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The absence of B and myeloid cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Intriguingly, geneome-wide analyses revealed patterns of DNA methylation that were strikingly similar between CMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells, but differed from those of canonical NK cells."
"Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of human PC3 invasive prostate cancer cell line treated with vehicle control (SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine) and with SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) as well as of untreated human LNCaP non-invasive prostate cancer cell line. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA Methylation BeadChip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in human cell lines exposed to described treatments. Samples included biological triplicate of PC3 control (SAH treated), biological triplicate of PC3 treated with SAM, and biological duplicate of LNCaP untreated."
"Results: This study aims at identifying epigenetic footprints of SE and EC cell lines in genome-wide profiles by studying the interaction between gene expression, DNA CpG methylation and histone modifications, and their function in GCC and related disruption of germ cell maturation. Two well characterized GCC-derived cell lines were compared, one representative for SE (TCam-2) and the other for EC (NCCIT). Data was acquired using the Illumina HumanHT-12-v4 (gene expression) and HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (methylation) microarrays as well as ChIP sequencing (activating histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac)). The data show that known germ cell markers are not only present and differentiating between SE and NS at the expression level, but also in the epigenetic landscape."
"Here, we determined the DNA methylation profiles of 12 human cell lines, including 2 ESC lines, 2 pESC lines,4 virally-delivered iPSC lines, 2 episomal-delivered iPSC lines, and 2 parent cell lines that iPSCs derived from using Illumina’s Infinium HumanMethylation450. The iPSCs exhibited a hypermethylation status similarly to ESCs but distinct differences from the parent cells. Genes of common methylation pattern between iPSCs and ESCs were regarded as critical factors for stemness, while differences existing between iPSCs and ESCs implied that iPSCs partly retained the parental characteristics and gained de novo methylation aberrances during cell reprogramming. No significant variant was identified between virally- and episomal- systems. De novo differentiated methylation regions as the signature of particular stem cell lines were figured out in detail in this study."

"Targeted approaches have revealed frequent epigenetic alterations in ovarian cancer, but the scope and relation of these changes to histologic subtype of disease is unclear. Genome-wide methylation and expression data for 14 clear cell carcinoma (CCC), 32 non-CCC, and 4 corresponding normal cell lines were generated to determine how methylation profiles differ between cells of different histological derivations of ovarian cancer. Consensus clustering showed that CCC is epigenetically distinct. Inverse relationships between expression and methylation in CCC were identified, suggesting functional regulation by methylation, and included 22 hypomethylated (UM) genes and 276 hypermethylated (HM) genes. Categorical and pathway analyses indicated that the CCC-specific UM genes were involved in response to stress and many contain hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1 binding sites, while the CCC-specific HM genes included members of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) network and genes involved in tumor development. We independently validated the methylation status of 17 of these pathway-specific genes, and confirmed increased expression of HNF1 network genes and repression of ERalpha pathway genes in CCC cell lines and primary cancer tissues relative to non-CCC specimens. Treatment of three CCC cell lines with the demethylating agent Decitabine significantly induced expression for all five genes analyzed. Coordinate changes in pathway expression were confirmed using two primary ovarian cancer datasets (p<0.0001 for both). Our results suggest that methylation regulates specific pathways and biological functions in CCC, with hypomethylation influencing the characteristic biology of the disease while hypermethylation contributes to the carcinogenic process."
"RESULTS: We show that patterns of methylation divide NSCLCs into EL and ML subsets as defined by gene expression and that these signatures are similarly correlated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors. We identify multiple DMRs, including ERBB2 and ZEB2, whose methylation status is strongly associated with an epithelial phenotype in NSCLC cell lines, surgically resected tumors, and formalin-fixed biopsies from NSCLC patients who went on to fail front-line chemotherapy."

"Background: Germ Cell Cancers (GCC), originating from Primordial Germ Cells /gonocytes, are the most common cancer in young men, subdivided in seminoma (SE) and non-seminoma (NS, stem cell component: embryonal carcinoma (EC)). Somatic mutations are rarely found in GCC. It has been proposed that disruption of the epigenetic constitution, either primarily or secondary (e.g. environmental influences), is involved in cancer, and specifically in GCC."
"To analysis of the effect of HOTAIR on global DNA methylation in KYSE180 esophageal cancer cell line, genome-scale DNA methylation was analyzed in a pair of esophageal cancer cell lines, KYSE180 cells stably transfected with HOTAIR and control KYSE180 cells.

"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a valuable resource for discovery of epigenetic changes critical to cell type-specific differentiation. Although iPS cells have been generated from other terminally differentiated cells, the reprogramming of normal adult human basal prostatic epithelial (E-PZ) cells to a pluripotent state has not been reported.  Here, we attempted to reprogram E-PZ cells by forced expression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 using lentiviral vectors and obtained embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like colonies at a frequency of 0.01%.  These E-PZ-iPS-like cells with normal karyotype gained expression of pluripotent genes typical of iPS cells (Tra-1-81, SSEA-3, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4) and lost gene expression characteristic of basal prostatic epithelial cells (CK5, CK14, and p63).  E-PZ-iPS-like cells demonstrated pluripotency by differentiating into ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal cells in vitro, although lack of teratoma formation in vivo and incomplete demethylation of pluripotency genes suggested only partial reprogramming.  Importantly, E-PZ-iPS-like cells re-expressed basal epithelial cell markers (CD44, p63, MAO-A) in response to prostate-specific medium in spheroid culture.  Androgen induced expression of androgen receptor (AR), and co-culture with rat urogenital sinus further induced expression of prostate-specific antigen, a hallmark of secretory cells, suggesting that E-PZ-iPS-like cells have the capacity to differentiate into prostatic basal and secretory epithelial cells.  Finally, when injected into mice, E-PZ-iPS-like cells expressed basal epithelial cell markers including CD44 and p63.  When co-injected with rat urogenital mesenchyme, E-PZ-iPS-like cells expressed AR and expression of p63 and CD44 was repressed. DNA methylation profiling identified key pathways and regulators of prostatic differentiation including Wnt5a, BPM7, PTEN, and NKx3.1 using E-PZ-iPS-lke cells. Our results suggest that iPS-like cells can be derived from prostatic epithelial cells.  These cells are pluripotent and capable of prostatic differentiation, and therefore provide a novel model for investigating epigenetic changes involved in prostate cell lineage specification."
"Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and trisomic placentas, and maternal blood cell DNA. The aim of this study was to search for methylation differences between maternal and fetal(placenta) cell free DNA, and between normal and trisomic placentas for an optimized methylation based noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aberations.   The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in DNA samples from Chorionic villus samples(CVS)  and DNA samples from whole blood. Samples included 12 Maternal blood cell samples from normal pregnancies, 12 normal CVS, 12 Trisomy 21 CVS, 12 trisomy 18 CVS and 6  trisomy 13 CVS samples."

To induce expression of androgen receptor (AR), E-PZ-iPS-like spheres were further cultured in Complete PFMR-4A medium with 10 nM R1881 for 3 days.  To induce expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), E-PZ-iPS-like spheres were co-cultured with rat urogenital sinus (UGS) isolated from E17 rat embryos as previously described [31] in Complete PFMR-4A medium with 10 nM R1881 for 5 days."
"Non-CG methylation is an unexplored epigenetic hallmark of pluripotent stem cells.  Here we report that a reduction in non-CG methylation is associated with impaired differentiation capacity into endodermal lineages. Genome-wide analysis of 2,670 non-CG sites in a discovery cohort of 25 phenotyped human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines revealed unidirectional loss (Δβ = 13%, p<7.4x10-4) of non-CG methylation that correctly identifies endodermal differentiation capacity in 23 out of 25 (92%) hiPSC lines.  Translation into a simplified assay of only 9 non-CG sites maintains predictive power in the discovery cohort (Δβ = 23%, p<9.1x10-6) and correctly identifies endodermal differentiation capacity in nince out of ten pluripotent stem cell lines in an independent replication cohort consisting of hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types and different delivery systems, as well as human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines.  This finding infers non-CG methylation at these sites as a biomarker when assessing endodermal differentiation capacity as a readout."
"Human ageing affects the immune system resulting in an overall decline in immunocompetence. Although all immune cells are affected during aging, the functional capacity of T cells is most influenced and is linked to decreased responsiveness to infections and impaired differentiation. We studied age-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from younger and older individuals. We observed marked difference between T cell subsets, with increased number of methylation changes and higher methylome variation in CD8+ T cells with age. The majority of age-related hypermethylated sites were located at CpG islands of silent genes and enriched for repressive histone marks. Specifically, in CD8+ T cell subset we identified strong inverse correlation between methylation and expression levels in genes associated with T cell mediated immune response (LGALS1, IFNG, CCL5, GZMH, CCR7, CD27 and CD248) and differentiation (SATB1, TCF7, BCL11B and RUNX3). Our results thus suggest the link between age-related epigenetic changes and impaired T cell function."
"Human pluripotent stem cells can be derived from somatic cells by forced expression of defined factors, and more recently by nuclear-transfer into human oocytes, revitalizing a debate on whether one reprogramming approach might be advantageous over the other. Here we compared the genetic and epigenetic stability of human nuclear-transfer embryonic stem cell (NT-ESC) lines and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, derived from the same somatic cell cultures of fetal, neonatal and adult origin. Both cell types shared similar genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. Importantly, NT-ESCs and iPSCs have comparable numbers of de novo coding mutations but significantly higher than parthenogenetic ESCs. Similar to iPSCs NT-ESCs displayed clone- and gene-specific aberrations in DNA methylation and allele-specific expression of imprinted genes, similarly to iPSCs. The occurrence of these genetic and epigenetic defects in both NT-ESCs and iPSCs suggests that they are inherent to reprogramming, regardless of the underlying technique."
"Human pluripotent stem cells hold great potential for regenerative medicine, but existing cell types have imitations. Human embryonic stem cells derived from fertilized embryos (IVF-ESCs) are considered the “gold standard”, but are allogeneic to potential recipients. Autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from somatic cells by forced expression of pluripotency-associated factors, but are prone to genetic and epigenetic aberrations. To determine whether accumulation of such aberrations is intrinsic to somatic cell reprogramming, or secondary to the reprogramming method, we employed an alternative approach by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). SCNT-based reprogramming to NT-ESCs is mediated by factors present in oocyte’s cytoplasm, thus mimicking early embryogenesis. We generated genetically matched pluripotent stem cells and conducted genome-wide genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional analyses. We discovered that unlike iPSCs, NT-ESCs have a low burden of de novo copy number variations (CNVs), reflecting superior maintenance of genetic stability. Moreover, DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of NT-ESCs corresponded closely to those of IVF-ESCs. In contrast, iPSCs harbored methylation abnormalities including residual CpG methylation typical of parental fibroblasts, suggesting incomplete reprogramming. We conclude that human somatic cells can be faithfully reprogrammed to pluripotency by SCNT with the potential to satisfy the clinical requirements for cell replacement therapies."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in world wide. During tumorigenesis, tumor suppressor and cancer-related genes are commonly silenced by aberrant DNA methylation in their promoter regions. Zebularine [1-(β-ᴅ-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one] acts as an inhibitor of DNA methylation and exhibits chemical stability and minimal cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explore the effect and possible mechanism of action of zebularine on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Here, we demonstrated that zebularine exhibited antitumor activity on HepG2 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Zebularine treatment down-regulated CDK2 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB), and up-regulated p21WAF/CIP1 and p53. We also found that zebularine treatment up-regulated phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK. These results suggest that p44/42 MAPK pathway play a role in zebularine induced cell cycle arrest by regulating activity of p21WAF/CIP1 and Rb. Furthermore, we found that zebularine induced apoptosis. Although proapoptotic protein Bax levels were not affected, antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 level was down-regulated with zebularine treatment. The data in the present study suggest that the action of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is involved in inducing apoptosis with zebularine. These results provide a novel mechanism of zebularine-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma."

"Germ cell tumours (GCTs) are a complex group of malignancies. They are unique in developing from a pluripotent progenitor cell. The initial lesion is believed to be the relatively benign precursor lesion (ICGNU), from which either highly chemosensitive seminomas or the more aggressive non-seminomas develop. Previous analyses of selected genes have suggested that non-seminomas exhibit much higher levels of DNA methylation than seminomas. However, the genomic targets that are methylated, the extent to which this results in gene silencing and the identity of the silenced genes most likely to play a role in the tumours’ biology have not yet been established.   Here genome-wide methylation and expression analysis of GCT cell lines was combined with gene expression data. This demonstrated that the seminoma cells exhibited very little aberrant DNA methylation while non-seminoma cells exhibited very high levels of DNA methylation. Large differences in the level of methylation of the CpG islands of individual genes between tumour cell lines correlated well with differential gene expression. Treatment of non-seminoma cells with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine verified that methylation of all genes tested did indeed play a role in their silencing and many of these genes were also differentially expressed in primary tumours. Through this approach the genes silenced in the various GCT cell lines were identified.   Conclusions: Several pluripotency-associated genes, never before implicated in this type of cancer, were identified as a major functional group of silenced genes. Silencing of these factors that normally suppress somatic differentiation might play an important role in the progression to non-seminoma formation."
"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a cancer arising from the neoplastic transformation of cholangiocytes. During tumorigenesis, tumor suppressor and cancer-related genes are commonly silenced by aberrant DNA methylation in their promoter regions. Zebularine (1-(β-D-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one) acts as an inhibitor of DNA methylation and exhibits chemical stability and minimal cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explore the effect and possible mechanism of action of zebularine on CCA cells. We demonstrate that zebularine exerts an antitumor effect on CCA cells. Zebularine treatment decreased the concentrations of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins, and DNMT1 knockdown led to apoptotic cell death in the CCA cell lines TFK-1 and HuCCT1. DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that zebularine induced DNA demethylation, and the GO Biological Process terms “hemophilic cell adhesion”, “regulation of transcription, DNAdependent” and “Wnt signaling pathway” were found to be significantly enriched in association with demethylated genes. Furthermore, we observed that zebularine treatment decreased β-catenin protein levels in TFK-1 and HuCCT1 cells. These results suggest that zebularine alters DNA methylation status, and that some aspect of DNA demethylation by zebularine induces suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway, which leads to apoptotic cell death in CCA. We previously reported a novel mechanism of zebularine-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma via a DNA methylation-independent pathway. Together, our present and previous studies indicate that zebularine could function as both a DNMT inhibitor and a non-DNMT inhibitor reagent, and that, while the optimal usage of zebularine may depend on cancer type, zebularine may be useful for chemotherapy against cancer."
"Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) show great potential for clinical and experimental use. Self-renewal and multipotent differentiation capacity are key elements in the increasing interest of this cell type. However, a disadvantage of primary hMSCs is the limited in vitro lifespan, but this can be overcome by introduction of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). In this paper, the generation and characterization of a TERT-immortalized, non-tumorigenic human bone marrow-derived stromal mesenchymal model cell line is described. The resulting cell line, iMSC#3, maintained capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes, and growth characteristics comparable to primary hMSCs into after long-term culturing (155 population doublings). A detailed characterization of the mRNA- and microRNA transcriptomes during adipocyte differentiation also showed that the iMSC#3 recapitulates this process at the molecular level. Furthermore, iMSC#3 showed no major differences from hMSCs regarding surface marker expression. The cell line had a normal karyotype, and high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed that the cells in general had normal copy number. The gene expression profiles of immortalized and primary hMSCs were also similar, whereas the corresponding methylation profiles were more diverse. In conclusion, a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line was developed, which can be used for basic studies of mesenchymal cells and to functionally study transgenes that might play a role in oncogenic transformation."

"Treatment of tumors with ionizing radiation for cancer therapy induces biological responses that include changes in cell cycle, activation of DNA repair mechanisms, and induction of apoptosis or senescence programs.  What is not known is whether ionizing radiation induces an epigenetic DNA methylation response or whether epigenetic changes occur in genes in pathways classically associated with the radiation response.  We exposed breast cancer cells to 0, 2, or 6 Gy and determined global DNA methylation at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-irradiation.  We found that radiation treatment resulted in a DNA methylation response and that cell cycle, DNA  repair, and apoptosis pathways were enriched in genes are were differentially-methylated."

"Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important mechanism in cancer.  Alterations in epigenetic machinery have become a major focus for new targeted therapies.  The current report describes the discovery and biological activity of a cyclopropylamine containing inhibitor of Lysine Demethylase 1 (LSD1), GSK2879552.  This small molecule is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of LSD1.  A proliferation screen of cell lines representing a number of tumor types indicated that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is sensitive to LSD1 inhibition.  The subset of SCLC lines and primary samples that undergo growth inhibition in response to GSK2879552 exhibit DNA hypomethylation of a signature set of probes suggesting this may be used as a predictive biomarker of activity.  The targeted mechanism coupled with a novel predictive biomarker make LSD1 inhibition an exciting potential therapy for SCLC, a highly prevalent, rarely cured, tumor type representing approximately 15% of all lung cancers."

"Global patterns of DNA methylation, mediated by the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), are disrupted in all cancers by mechanisms that remain largely unknown, hampering their development as therapeutic targets. Combinatorial acute depletion of all DNMTs in a pluripotent human tumor cell line, followed by epigenome and transcriptome analysis, revealed DNMT functions in unprecedented detail. DNMT3B occupancy regulates methylation during differentiation, while an unexpected interplay was discovered in which DNMT1 and DNMT3B antithetically regulate methylation and hydroxymethylation in gene bodies, a finding confirmed in other cell types. DNMT3B mediated nonCpG methylation, while DNMT3L influenced the activity of DNMT3B toward nonCpG versus CpG site methylation. Taken together, these data reveal new functional targets of each DNMT suggesting that isoform selective inhibition would be therapeutically advantageous."

"To obtain a comprehensive view of hPSC-specific epigenomic patterns, we collected 136 hESC and 69 hiPSC samples representing more than 100 cell lines for analysis.  In order to establish expected variation in human tissues, we collected 80 high-quality and well-replicated samples representing 17 distinct tissue types from multiple individuals. Finally, we selected 50 additional samples from primary cell lines of diverse origin to control for any aberrations that may arise as a general, non-hPSC-specific, consequence of in vitro manipulation. With these samples, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiling using the Illumina Infinium 27K and 450K DNA Methylation BeadChips as well as the Illumina HT12v3 Gene Expression BeadArray."
"Array-based DNA methylation profiling in peripheral blood leukocytes of 30 infertile men with impaired spermatogenesis as compared to 10 fertile men using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450k Bead Chip reveald 471 CpG sites (287 genes) to be differentially methylated between both groups. These CpG loci were significantly enriched for the gene ontology functions MHC class II receptor activity and piRNA binding. The latter was associated with two methylation-sensitive SNPs in the genes PIWIL1 and PIWIL2, respectivly, which showed significant allele distribution skewing in the infertile cohort. 445/471 differentially methylated CpGs were associated with SNPs, but 26 (15 genes) were not genomically templated and included the ENO1, MTA2, BRSK2 and LBX2 genes previously associated with fertility and spermatogenesis. The study identifies surrogate DNA methylation markers for idiopathic infertility in peripheral blood and suggests allele-specific DNA methylation differences at regulatory sites of genes involved in piRNA regulation to be associated with disturbed spermatogenesis."
"Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common endocrine hypertension comprising 10% of hypertensive patients. A recent series of transcriptome analyses using DNA microarray has shown that neumerous genes are differentially expressed between aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and its adjacent adrenal gland (AAG) tissue from the same patient. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of pathogenesis of APA has not yet been fully clarified. Although growing body of evidence has shown that epigenetic abnormalities including DNA methylation play a key role in tumorigenesis, there are few studies with regard to DNA methylation in APA. In the present study, to elucidate the pathogenic relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation in PA, we conducted an integrated analysis of transcriptome and methylome data for paired APA-AAG samples from the same patient. Adrenal specimens were obtained from 7 Japanese patients with APA, who underwent adrenalectomy at Tokyo Medical and Dental University. RNA and DNA samples were extracted from those 7 paired APA and AAG tissues. Gene expression and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were obtained using SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Agilent) and Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip (Illumina), respectively. Transcriptome anlaysis identified 244 significantly (2 fold<) upregulated genes in APA compared to AAG. The upregulated genes include the previously studied genes such as PCP4, ALDH1A2, and CYP11B2, and other genes that have not been previously studied, such as HOXA9, HOXA11, and HOXB9. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for these upregulated genes identified the calcium signaling pathway to be most significantly enriched with the upregulated genes (8 genes). Methylome analysis revealed that APA was globally hypomethylated compared to AAG regardless of gene feature groups, namely, TSS1500, TSS200, 5’UTR, 1stExon, gene body, and 3’UTR. GO analysis for the genes showing hypomethylation at TSS1500/TSS200 regions in APA identified the term “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction” to be most significantly enriched with hypomethylated genes (37 genes). Integrated analysis of gene expression and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles identified 18 genes that are upregulated and whose TSS1500/TSS200 regions are hypomethylated in APA compared to AAG. These genes include CYP11B2 and MC2R (ACTH receptor). In conclusion, this is the first genome-wide study for PA that integrated transcriptome and methylome data. Global DNA hypomethylation in APA and concordant transcriptional up-regulation of some key genes, such as CYP11B2 and MC2R, may play crucial roles in the pathophysiological significance in PA."
"Age-related changes in DNA methylation occurring in blood leukocytes during early childhood may reflect epigenetic maturation. We hypothesized that some of these changes involve gene networks of critical relevance in leukocyte biology and conducted a prospective study to elucidate the dynamics of DNA methylation. Serial blood samples were collected at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after birth in 10 healthy girls born in Finland and participating in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study. DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. After filtering for the presence of polymorphisms and cell-lineage-specific signatures, 794 CpGs showed significant DNA methylation differences as a function of age in all children (41.5% age-methylated and 58.4% age-demethylated, bonferroni corrected p-value <0.001). Age-methylated CpGs were more frequently located in gene bodies and within +5 to +50 kilobases (kb) of transcription start sites (TSS), and enriched in developmental, neuronal and plasma membrane genes. Age-demethylated CpGs were associated to promoters and DNAse-I hypersensitivity sites, located within -5 to +5 kb of the nearest TSS, and enriched in genes related to immunity, antigen presentation, the polycomb-group protein complex and cytoplasm. This study reveals that susceptibility loci for complex inflammatory diseases (e.g. IRF5, NOD2, PTGER4) and genes encoding histone modifiers and chromatin remodeling factors (e.g. HDAC4, KDM2A, KDM2B, JARID2, ARID3A, SMARCD3) undergo DNA methylation changes in leukocytes during early childhood. These results open new perspectives to understand leukocyte maturation and provide a catalog of CpGs that may need to be corrected for age effects when performing DNA methylation studies in children."

"Comparative studies in primates are extremely restricted because we only have access to a few types of cell lines from non-human apes and to a limited collection of frozen tissues. In order to gain better insight into regulatory processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of tissues and cell types. To facilitate this, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from fibroblasts of healthy donors. All lines are free of integration from exogenous reprogramming vectors, can be maintained using standard iPSC culture techniques, and have proliferative and differentiation potential similar to human and mouse lines. To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-seq data and methylation profiles from the chimpanzee iPSCs and their corresponding fibroblast precursors, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their precursors, which were of multiple cell type and population origins. Overall, we observed much less regulatory variation within species in the iPSCs than in the somatic precursors, indicating that the reprogramming process has erased many of the differences observed between somatic cells of different origins. We identified 4,918 differentially expressed genes and 1,986 differentially methylated regions between iPSCs of the two species, many of which are novel inter-species differences and not observed between the somatic cells of the two species. Our panel will help realise the potential of iPSCs, and in combination with genomic technologies, transform studies of comparative evolution in primates."

The filtered virus stocks were either frozen at -80C or diluted 1:2 in DMEM/10%FBS containing 8ug/ml Polybrene (to give a final conc. of 4ug/ml) and added to SCC003 cells grown to a confluence of 40-50%. Following overnight incubation, the cells were washed to remove virus and medium was replaced with DMEM/10%FBS. At 48-72hrs post-infection cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:5 into selection medium containing 400ug/ml G418. Following death of all mock-infected cells (approx. 1 – 2 weeks), cells were removed from selection and plated at limiting dilution in 96 well plates to generate single cell clones. HPV-16 E6 and E7 qPCR was conducted as described (Wang-Johanning et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2005).

"During embryonic development, the lymphatic system emerges by transdifferentiation from the cardinal vein. Although lymphatic and blood vasculature share a close molecular and developmental relationship, they display distinct features and functions. However, even after terminal differentiation, transitions between the two endothelial cell types have been reported. Since changes in phenotypic plasticity and cellular differentiation processes frequently involve epigenetic mechanisms, we wondered whether DNA methylation might play a role in regulating cell type-specific expression in endothelial cells. By analyzing global gene expression and methylation patterns of primary human dermal lymphatic and blood endothelial cells, we identified a highly significant set of genes, which were differentially methylated and expressed. Pathway analyses of the differentially methylated and upregulated genes in lymphatic endothelial cells revealed involvement in developmental and transdifferentiation processes. We further identified a set of novel genes, which might be implicated in regulating BEC-LEC plasticity and could serve as therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers in vascular diseases associated with alterations in the endothelial phenotype."

"Placental tissues were collected from consenting healthy women undergoing elective pregnancy termination at gestational ages between 7-9 weeks.  dNK were isolated from decidua after collagenase and hyaluronidase digestion, depletion of attached cells, and were then enriched by human NK cell enrichment cocktail following the manufacturer’s instructions. The percentage of CD56+/CD16- dNK reached ~87%, CD16+ cells were < 2.1% (Hu et al., 2006). The dNK were trapped inside of hollow fiber (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominquez, CA, USA) (HF-dNK) and used for co-culturing with explants in order to eliminate trophoblast cell contamination from dNK when performing EVT DNA extraction. HF permits soluble factors with molecular weight below 500 kDa to be exchanged freely. For each placental specimen, villous explant cultures were set up in 12 well plates on collagen gel. After overnight incubation, explant cultures with EVT outgrowth on villous tips were identified and exposed to medium control (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS), or IL-15 alone, or concordant HF-dNK plus IL-15 for a total of 96 hours. 6-8 explants were used for each treatment group in each placental specimen."
"Melanoma resistance to MAPK- or T cell checkpoint-targeted therapies represents a major clinical challenge, and treatment failures of MAPK-targeted therapies due to acquired resistance often require salvage immunotherapies. We show that genomic analysis of acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors revealed key driver genes but failedto adequately account for clinical resistance. From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. Moreover, integration of gene- and signature-based transcriptomic analysis revealed profound CD8 T cell deficiency detected in half of resistant melanomas in association with downregulation of dendritic cells and antigen presentation. We also propose a major methylomic basis to transcriptomic evolution under MAPK inhibitor selection. Thus, this database provides a rich informational resource, and the current landscape represents a benchmark to understanding melanoma therapeutic resistance."
"In differentiated cells, aging is associated with hypermethylation of DNA regions enriched in repressive histone posttranslational modifications. However, the chromatin marks associated with changes in DNA methylation in adult stem cells during lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, DNA methylation profiling of mesenchymal stem cells obtained from individuals aged 2 to 92 identified 18735 hypermethylated and 45407 hypomethylated CpG sites associated with aging. As in differentiated cells, hypermethylated sequences were enriched in chromatin repressive marks. Most importantly, hypomethylated CpG sites were strongly enriched in the active chromatin mark H3K4me1 in stem and differentiated cells, suggesting this is a cell type-independent chromatin signature of DNA hypomethylation during aging. Analysis of scedasticity showed that interindividual variability of DNA methylation increased during aging in MSCs and differentiated cells, providing a new avenue for the identification of DNA methylation changes over time. DNA methylation profiling of genetically identical individuals showed that both the tendency of DNA methylation changes and scedasticity depended on non-genetic as well as genetic factors. Our results indicate that the dynamics of DNA methylation during aging depend on a complex mixture of factors that include the DNA sequence, cell type and chromatin context involved, and that, depending on the locus, the changes can be modulated by genetic and/or external factors."

Analysis of scedasticity showed that interindividual variability of DNA methylation increased during aging in MSCs and differentiated cells, providing a new avenue for the identification of DNA methylation changes over time. DNA methylation profiling of genetically identical individuals showed that both the tendency of DNA methylation changes and scedasticity depended on non-genetic as well as genetic factors. Our results indicate that the dynamics of DNA methylation during aging depend on a complex mixture of factors that include the DNA sequence, cell type and chromatin context involved, and that, depending on the locus, the changes can be modulated by genetic and/or external factors."

"Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are complex disorders, whose etiopathology is attributed to a crosstalk between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Both variants of autoimmune susceptibility genes and environment are involved in the generation of aberrant epigenetic profiles in a cell-specific manner, which ultimately result in dysregulation of expression. Furthermore, changes in miRNA expression profiles also cause gene dysregulation associated with aberrant phenotypes. In rheumatoid arthritis, several cell types are involved in the destruction of the joints, synovial fibroblasts being among the most important. In this study we performed DNA methylation and miRNA expression screening of a set of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts and compared the results with those obtained from osteoarthritis patients with a normal phenotype. DNA methylation screening allowed us to identify changes in novel key target genes like IL6R, CAPN8 and DPP4, as well as several HOX genes. A significant proportion of genes undergoing DNA methylation changes were inversely correlated with expression. miRNA screening revealed the existence of subsets of miRNAs that underwent changes in expression. Integrated analysis highlighted sets of miRNAs that are controlled by DNA methylation, and genes that are regulated by DNA methylation and are targeted by miRNAs with a potential use as clinical markers. Our study enabled the identification of novel dysregulated targets in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts and generated a new workflow for the integrated analysis of miRNA and epigenetic control."

"Standardization of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains a major obstacle in regenerative medicine. Starting material and culture expansion affect cell preparations and render comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) assimilate towards a ground-state and may therefore give rise to more standardized cell preparations. We reprogrammed bone marrow MSCs into iPSCs which were subsequently re-differentiated towards MSCs. These iPS-MSCs revealed similar morphology, immunophenotype, in vitro differentiation potential, and gene expression profiles as primary MSCs. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of iPSCs maintained some donor-specific characteristics, whereas tissue-specific, senescence-associated, and age-related DNAm patterns were erased during reprogramming. iPS-MSCs reacquired senescence-associated DNAm during culture expansion but they remained rejuvenated with regard to age-related DNAm. Overall, iPS-MSCs and MSCs are similar in function but differ in their epigenetic makeup."

"Methylation of cytosines at CpG sites is a common epigenetic DNA modification that can be measured by a large number of methods, now even in a genome-wide manner for hundreds of thousands of sites. The application of DNA methylation analysis is becoming widely popular in complex disorders, for example, to understand part of the “missing inheritance”. The DNA samples most readily available for methylation studies are derived from whole blood. However, blood consists of many functionally and developmentally distinct cell populations in varying proportions. We studied whether such variation might affect the interpretation of methylation studies based on whole blood DNA. We found in healthy male blood donors there is important variation in the methylation profiles of whole blood, mononuclear cells, granulocytes, and cells from seven selected purified lineages. CpG methylation between mononuclear cells and granulocytes differed for 22% of the 8252 probes covering the selected 343 genes implicated in immune-related disorders by genome-wide association studies, and at least one probe was differentially methylated for 85% of the genes, indicating that whole blood methylation results might be unintelligible. For individual genes, even if the overall methylation patterns might appear similar, a few CpG sites in the regulatory regions may have opposite methylation patterns (i.e., hypo/hyper) in the main blood cell types. We conclude that interpretation of whole blood methylation profiles should be performed with great caution and for any differences implicated in a disorder, the differences resulting from varying proportions of white blood cell types should be considered."
"Background: In a recent intervention study, the daily supplementation with 200 mg monomeric and oligomeric flavanols (MOF) from grape seeds for 8 weeks revealed a vascular health benefit in male smokers. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of MOF consumption on the gene expression profile of leukocytes and to assess changes in DNA methylation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Gene expression profiles were determined using whole genome microarrays (Agilent) and DNA methylation was assessed using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina). MOF significantly modulated the expression of 864 genes. The majority of the affected genes are involved in chemotaxis, cell adhesion, cell infiltration or cytoskeleton organisation, suggesting lower immune cell adhesion to endothelial cells. This was corroborated by in vitro experiments showing that MOF exposure of monocytes attenuates their adhesion to TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) reporter gene assays confirmed that MOF decrease the activity of NF-κB. Strong inter-individual variability in the leukocytes’ DNA methylation was observed. As a consequence, on group level, changes due to MOF supplementation could not be found. However, in individuals, significant changes in DNA methylation of genes involved in leukocyte rolling, adhesion and cytoskeleton remodelling were seen. Conclusion: Our study revealed that regular consumption of MOF modulates the expression of genes in immune cells which, however, cannot be correlated to alterations in the DNA methylome. Remarkably, at the individual level, genes related to leukocyte adhesion pathways present complex variation in DNA methylation. As such, the individual transcriptional and epigenetic modulation of genes involved in early manifestation of cardiovascular diseases constitutes important subcellular mechanisms by which MOF promote vascular health in humans."
"Recurrent mutations in histone modifying enzymes in multiple cancer types imply key roles in tumorigenesis. However, the functional relevance of these mutations remains unknown. Here we show that the JARID1B histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase is frequently amplified and overexpressed in luminal breast tumors and a somatic point mutation of JARID1B leads to the gain of luminal-specific gene expression programs. Downregulation of JARID1B in luminal breast cancer cells induces the expression of basal cell-specific genes and growth arrest, which is partially rescued by the inhibition of TGFBR thereby indicating a key role for TGFb signaling. Integrated genome-wide analysis of JARID1B chromatin binding, histone H3 lysine trimethyl (H3K4me3) and dimethyl (H3K4me2) patterns, and gene expression profiles in luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells suggest a key role for JARID1B in luminal cell-specific gene expression programs. A significant fraction of JARID1B binding-sites overlaps with CTCF in both luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells. CTCF also co-immunoprecipitates with JARID1B and it may influence its histone demethylase (HDM) activity as the H3K4me3/me2 ratio is lower at the CTCF-overlapping compared to JARID1B-unique sites. Additionally, a heterozygous JARID1B missense mutation (K1435R) in the HCC2157 basal-like breast cancer cell line is associated with unique JARID1B chromatin-binding and gene expression patterns implying gain of luminal features. In line with this, exogenous expression of this mutant in basal-like breast cancer cells leads to a gain of JARID1B binding at many luminal-specific genes. A PARADIGM score reflecting JARID1B activity in luminal breast cancer cells is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with luminal breast tumors. Together, our data imply that JARID1B is a luminal lineage-driving oncogene and that its therapeutic targeting may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in treatment-resistant luminal breast tumors."
