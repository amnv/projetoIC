"Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 486,000 CpGs. The trabecular bone pieces were obtained from the central part of the femoral head of Spanish (Caucasian) patients with hip fractures (due to osteoporosis) or subjects with osteoarthritis. About 85% of the cell population in this bone tissue are osteocytes and the remainder are osteoblasts, bone marrow, etc."

"In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation characteristics of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) form different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT ), umbilical cord (UC) as well as dermal fibroblasts by using the HumanMethylation450K array. Cells able to form bone through endochondral ossification and attract bone marrow in an innovative in vivo model were compared to cells lacking these capacities. Interestingly only BM-derived MSPCs were capable of bone formation and marrow attraction. These features correlated with unique epigenetic characteristics potentially enabling BM-derived cells to undergo endochondral ossification."

"We compared the gene methylation profile of 26 breast cancer cell lines to identify variations associated with different phenotypes and molecular subtype. The panel includes 13 estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and 13 ER+ cell lines. Four of the ER- cell lines and 5 of the ER+ cell lines are HER2 positive."
"Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."

"""Epigenetic and in vivo comparison of diverse mesenchymal stromal cell sources reveals an endochonrdal signature for human hematopoietic niche formation """
"""Public on Apr 30 2014"""
"""Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."""
"""MSCs from BM, WAT, UC and skin were isolated using plastic adherence. Cells were expanded in standard alpha-MEM supplemented with pooled human platelet lysate fully replacing fetal bovine serum.

The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in the samples. Samples included 20 leukemia stem cells, 24 blast cells and 30 normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (6 different types from 5 normal bone marrows)."
"MSCs from BM, WAT, UC and skin were isolated using plastic adherence. Cells were expanded in standard alpha-MEM supplemented with pooled human platelet lysate fully replacing fetal bovine serum. MSCs were subcutaneously implanted into immune-compromised mice to comparatively evaluate bone formation and subsequent bone marrow attraction. In parallel we have isolated RNA from all sources to analyze tissue source specific gene expression profile."
"Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain n=64 Illumina DNA methylation arrays from 30 tissues. For each of the following tissues, we obtained at least 2 replicates: adipose, adrenal gland, aorta, bone, bone-marrow, breast, buccal cells, cartilage, cerebellum, colon, diaphragm, esophagus , frontal cortex, kidney, heart, hippocampus, liver, lung, lymph node, midbrain,  muscle, occipital cortex, pancreas, pericardium skin, spleen, stomach, temporal cortex, thyroid, whole blood."
"Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K Beadchip was performed on a total of 21 human cell lines, including: an isogenic set of 3 nuclear-transfer embryonic stem cell (NT-ESC) lines, 2 RNA-reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and their parental neonatal fibroblast cell line; an isogenic set of 1 NT-ESC line, 6 iPSC lines and their parental adult fibroblast cell line (derived from a type 1 diabetic subject); as well as 7 control embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines."

The hypothesis tested in the present study was that cell type of origin affects iPSC gene expression. Results show that individual has a much stronger effect than cell type of origin on differences between iPSCs derived from multiple individuals."
"The study includes 101 individuals, 50 young and 51 old, no replicates. From each individual there are CD4 and CD8 T-cell and peripheral blood samples extracted. The total number of samples is 296, of which 99 have CD4 T -cell, 100 have CD8 T-cell and 97 have peripheral blood data."

For 8 indibiduals, DNAs and RNAs were isolated and the methylation and expression changes during early B-cell development were identified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip (Illumina) and GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix)."
"We performed whole-genome methylation analysis using 450K Illumina BeadArrays on 124 tumors including 83 adenocarcinomas, 23 squamous cell carcinomas, one adenosquamous cancer, five large cell carcinomas, nine large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC), three small cell carcinomas (SCLC) and 12 normal lung tissues. Unsupervised class discovery was performed to identify DNA methylation subgroups with clinicopathological and molecular features. Subgroups were validated in two independent NSCLC cohorts."
"The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of human bone tissue and to relate it to chronological age. Toward this end, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115.

"Matrix elasticity influences differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) but it is unclear if these effects are only transient - while the cells reside on the substrate - or if they reflect persistent lineage commitment. In this study, MSCs were continuously culture-expanded in parallel either on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gels of different elasticity or on tissue culture plastic (TCP) to compare impact on replicative senescence, in vitro differentiation, gene expression, and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. The maximal number of cumulative population doublings was not affected by matrix elasticity. Differentiation towards adipogenic and osteogenic lineage was increased on soft and rigid biomaterials, respectively - but this propensity was no more evident if cells were transferred to TCP. Global gene expression profiles and DNAm profiles revealed relatively few differences in MSCs cultured on soft or rigid matrices. Furthermore, only moderate DNAm changes were observed upon culture on very soft hydrogels of human platelet lysate (hPL-gel). Our results support the notion that matrix elasticity influences cellular differentiation while the cells are organized on the substrate, but it does not have major impact on cell-intrinsic lineage determination, replicative senescence or DNAm patterns."
