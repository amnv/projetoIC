"Genome wide DNA methylation differences in umbilical cord blood  (UCB) of preterm and term born neonates. The Illumina 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain the DNA methylation profiles of 12 preterm and 12 term UCB samples  across 450,000 CpGs. 2 samples were removed due to failed quality control, and BMIQ normalization was done with 11 preterm and 11 term samples."

"Twenty mother-newborn dyads, after uncomplicated pregnancies, in the absence of perinatal illness were included. All mothers were healthy with no cardiovascular risk factors, except for the associated risks among those mothers who smoked. Umbilical cord blood were collected and an epigenome-wide association study was performed using a 450K epigenome-wide scan (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450BeadChip) with adjustment to normalize the DNA methylation for data cell variability in whole blood."

"Methods: Twenty mother-newborn dyads, after uncomplicated pregnancies, in the absence of perinatal illness were included. All mothers were healthy with no cardiovascular risk factors, except for the associated risks among those mothers who smoked. Umbilical cord blood (for methylation arrays) and maternal peripheral venous blood (for cotine level measurement) were collected and an epigenome-wide association study was performed using a 450K epigenome-wide scan (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450BeadChip) with adjustment to normalize the DNA methylation for data cell variability in whole blood."

"In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation characteristics of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) form different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT ), umbilical cord (UC) as well as dermal fibroblasts by using the HumanMethylation450K array. Cells able to form bone through endochondral ossification and attract bone marrow in an innovative in vivo model were compared to cells lacking these capacities. Interestingly only BM-derived MSPCs were capable of bone formation and marrow attraction. These features correlated with unique epigenetic characteristics potentially enabling BM-derived cells to undergo endochondral ossification."

"Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."

"Genomewide methylation profiles from three tissues (cord blood, placenta, venous blood) derived from 24 mother-child dyads. Data was assayed with the Illumina HumanMethylation 450K Beacdchip and processed with Illumina's GenomeStudio V2011.1 Methylation Module v1.9.0"

"CD34+ cells were isolated from fresh umbilical cord blood after written consent according to the guidelines specifically approved by the Ethic Committee of RWTH Aachen University (Permit Number: EK187/08) using  the CD34 Micro Bead Kit on a MiniMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Cells were cultured in StemSpan serum free expansion medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Grenoble, France) supplemented with 10 µg/mL heparin (ratiopharm, GmbH, Ulm, Germany), 20 ng/mL thrombopoietin (TPO; PeproTech GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), 10 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF; PeproTech), 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1; PeproTech). Culture was either performed on tissue culture plastic (TCP) or on a confluent layer of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs; passage 3 to 6). After seven days, CD34+ and CD34- fractions were again separated as described above."

"""Epigenetic and in vivo comparison of diverse mesenchymal stromal cell sources reveals an endochonrdal signature for human hematopoietic niche formation """
"""Public on Apr 30 2014"""
"""Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."""
"""MSCs from BM, WAT, UC and skin were isolated using plastic adherence. Cells were expanded in standard alpha-MEM supplemented with pooled human platelet lysate fully replacing fetal bovine serum. MSCs were subcutaneously implanted into immune-compromised mice to comparatively evaluate bone formation and subsequent bone marrow attraction. In parallel we have isolated RNA from all sources to analyze tissue source specific gene expression profile."""
