"Genome wide DNA methylation differences in umbilical cord blood  (UCB) of preterm and term born neonates.
The Illumina 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain the DNA methylation profiles of 12 preterm and 12 term UCB samples  across 450,000 CpGs.
2 samples were removed due to failed quality control, and BMIQ normalization was done with 11 preterm and 11 term samples."
"Twenty mother-newborn dyads, after uncomplicated pregnancies, in the absence of perinatal illness were included.
All mothers were healthy with no cardiovascular risk factors, except for the associated risks among those mothers who smoked.
Umbilical cord blood were collected and an epigenome-wide association study was performed using a 450K epigenome-wide scan (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450BeadChip) with adjustment to normalize the DNA methylation for data cell variability in whole blood."
"Methods: Twenty mother-newborn dyads, after uncomplicated pregnancies, in the absence of perinatal illness were included.
All mothers were healthy with no cardiovascular risk factors, except for the associated risks among those mothers who smoked.
Umbilical cord blood (for methylation arrays) and maternal peripheral venous blood (for cotine level measurement) were collected and an epigenome-wide association study was performed using a 450K epigenome-wide scan (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450BeadChip) with adjustment to normalize the DNA methylation for data cell variability in whole blood."
"In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation characteristics of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) form different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT ), umbilical cord (UC) as well as dermal fibroblasts by using the HumanMethylation450K array.
Cells able to form bone through endochondral ossification and attract bone marrow in an innovative in vivo model were compared to cells lacking these capacities.
Interestingly only BM-derived MSPCs were capable of bone formation and marrow attraction.
These features correlated with unique epigenetic characteristics potentially enabling BM-derived cells to undergo endochondral ossification."
"Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.
Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction.
To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."
