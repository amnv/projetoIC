"In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation characteristics of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) form different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT ), umbilical cord (UC) as well as dermal fibroblasts by using the HumanMethylation450K array. Cells able to form bone through endochondral ossification and attract bone marrow in an innovative in vivo model were compared to cells lacking these capacities. Interestingly only BM-derived MSPCs were capable of bone formation and marrow attraction. These features correlated with unique epigenetic characteristics potentially enabling BM-derived cells to undergo endochondral ossification."
"Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."

"During embryogenesis, body growth and repair the bone substance is formed by osteoblasts, which are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) have many of the properties of multipotent stem cells, and can be differentiated towards osteoblasts in vitro, making these cells a convenient tool for investigation of osteogenesis. We here describe the pattern of gene expression, histone modification and DNA binding of the bone master regulator RUNX2 during osteogenic differentiation of an immortalized human bone marrow-derived MSC cell line. By sequencing of immuno¬precipi¬tated chromatin we generated high resolution maps of enrichment of five histone H3 modifications associated with different functional states of chromatin, and identified differentiation-induced epigenetic changes. By the same approach, several thousand binding sites for the transcription factor RUNX2 was mapped to around 1900 target genes in differentiated osteoblasts. RUNX2 target genes were associated with cellular growth, movement, apoptosis and PDGF BB and p53 signaling. Surprisingly, RUNX2 was found to bind both at the 5’ and 3’ ends of genes, and also at distal regulatory elements, and was co-localized with activating histone modifications at approximately half of bound sites. This is to our knowledge the first genome-wide description of RUNX2 targets in bone biology. Further, we identified GTF2I and TEAD2 as regulators of differentiation by computational prediction of over-represented transcription factor motifs in regions with differential histone modification enrichment. The predictions were confirmed by siRNA knockdown of the transcription factors which lead to inhibition of differentiation."
"Human fetal bone marrow was obtained, and using flow cytometry antibodies, four populations of B-cell developmental stages including stage 1 (S1; predominantly multipotent progenitors before lineage commitment and common lymphoid progenitors), stage II (S2; pre-B-I cells), stage 3 (S3; pre-B-II cells) and stage 4 cells (S4; immature B cells). For 8 indibiduals, DNAs and RNAs were isolated and the methylation and expression changes during early B-cell development were identified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip (Illumina) and GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix)."
"Primary hMSCs were obtained from the hip of a healthy donor after informed consent. Mononuclear cells from the bone marrow were isolated using standard density centrifugation and cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) Alpha medium (cat. no. 22561) supplemented with 20% FBS (PAA Laboratories), GlutaMAX, penicillin (100U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) (all from Life Technologies) at 37C and 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed after approximately 24 h by replacement of the medium. Subsequently, the adherent cells were allowed to expand until 70% confluence (5–6 days) before they were harvested and further expanded. iMSC#3 were grown under the same condition as hMSCs, but the medium was supplemented with 10% FBS."

"Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) show great potential for clinical and experimental use. Self-renewal and multipotent differentiation capacity are key elements in the increasing interest of this cell type. However, a disadvantage of primary hMSCs is the limited in vitro lifespan, but this can be overcome by introduction of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). In this paper, the generation and characterization of a TERT-immortalized, non-tumorigenic human bone marrow-derived stromal mesenchymal model cell line is described. The resulting cell line, iMSC#3, maintained capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes, and growth characteristics comparable to primary hMSCs into after long-term culturing (155 population doublings). A detailed characterization of the mRNA- and microRNA transcriptomes during adipocyte differentiation also showed that the iMSC#3 recapitulates this process at the molecular level. Furthermore, iMSC#3 showed no major differences from hMSCs regarding surface marker expression. The cell line had a normal karyotype, and high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed that the cells in general had normal copy number. The gene expression profiles of immortalized and primary hMSCs were also similar, whereas the corresponding methylation profiles were more diverse. In conclusion, a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line was developed, which can be used for basic studies of mesenchymal cells and to functionally study transgenes that might play a role in oncogenic transformation."
"MSCs were isolated from bone marrow (tibia plateau) after written consent using guidelines approved by the Ethic Committee of the Use of Human Subjects at the University of Aachen (permit number: EK128/09). MSCs from three donors were infected with pMXs based retroviruses (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) carrying the OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC genes. Established iPSCs were maintained on MEFs in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with Glutamax, 20% knockout serum replacer, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 1x L-glutamine, 0.1 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, and 50 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany). To exclude contamination of feeder layer cells, iPSCs were adjusted to a feeder-free system on matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) in mTeSR™1 medium (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) for at least three passages. Cells were passaged every 5-6 days enzymatically with dispase (1 g/ml, Stemcell Technologies). For re-differentiation of iPSC towards iPS-MSCs medium was simply exchanged for MSC standard medium supplemented with 10% human platelet lysate (hPL) for 7 days, and cells were then further passaged in culture wells coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, CA, USA)."

"The origin of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we elucidated the DNA methylome in primary Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) and the role of PML-RARa in establishing these patterns. APL patients showed increased genome-wide DNA methylation with higher variability than healthy CD34+ cells, promyelocytes and remission bone marrow. A core set of differentially methylated regions in APL was identified.  Age at diagnosis, Sanz score and Flt3-mutation status characterized methylation subtypes. Transcription factor binding sites, e.g. c-myc binding sites were associated with low methylation. SUZ12 and REST binding sites identified in embryonic stem cells were, however, preferentially DNA hypermethylated in APL. Unexpectedly, PML-RARa binding sites were also protected from aberrant DNA methylation in APL.  In line, myeloid cells from pre-leukemic PML-RARa knock-in mice did not show altered DNA methylation and expression of PML-RARa in hematopoietic progenitor cells prevented differentiation without affecting DNA methylation. ATRA treatment of APL blasts did also not result in DNA methylation changes. These results suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with leukemia phenotype but not required for PML-RARa-mediated initiation of leukemogenesis."

"Standardization of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains a major obstacle in regenerative medicine. Starting material and culture expansion affect cell preparations and render comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) assimilate towards a ground-state and may therefore give rise to more standardized cell preparations. We reprogrammed bone marrow MSCs into iPSCs which were subsequently re-differentiated towards MSCs. These iPS-MSCs revealed similar morphology, immunophenotype, in vitro differentiation potential, and gene expression profiles as primary MSCs. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of iPSCs maintained some donor-specific characteristics, whereas tissue-specific, senescence-associated, and age-related DNAm patterns were erased during reprogramming. iPS-MSCs reacquired senescence-associated DNAm during culture expansion but they remained rejuvenated with regard to age-related DNAm. Overall, iPS-MSCs and MSCs are similar in function but differ in their epigenetic makeup."
"""Despite similarities in morphology, phenotype and in vitro behavior, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) form various tissue sources show striking differences in their in vivo potential to form bone, cartilage and hematopoietic support tissue.  Comparing four commonly use MSC sources (bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT), umbilical cord (UC) and skin) we found only bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs capable of endochondral ossification and marrow attraction. To gain mechanistic insights explaining this differences we analyzed gene expression characteristics of MSC from all four tissue sources using  Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array."""
"""MSCs from BM, WAT, UC and skin were isolated using plastic adherence. Cells were expanded in standard alpha-MEM supplemented with pooled human platelet lysate fully replacing fetal bovine serum. MSCs were subcutaneously implanted into immune-compromised mice to comparatively evaluate bone formation and subsequent bone marrow attraction. In parallel we have isolated RNA from all sources to analyze tissue source specific gene expression profile."""

"Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is an epigenetic phenomenon. It has been suggested that iPSC retain some tissue-specific memory whereas little is known about inter-individual epigenetic variation of iPSC clones. In this study we have reprogrammed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from human bone marrow by retrovirus-mediated overexpression of OCT-3/4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4. Global DNA-methylation profiles of the initial MSC, MSC-derived iPSC (iP-MSC) and embryonic stem cells (ESC) were then compared using a high density DNA-methylation array covering more than 450,000 CpG sites. Overall, DNA-methylation patterns of iP-MSC and ESC were similar whereas some CpG sites revealed highly significant differences, which were not related to parental MSC. Furthermore, hypermethylation in iP-MSC versus ESC was particularly enriched in developmental genes as well as shore regions next to CpG islands indicating that these differences are not due to tissue-specific memory or random de novo methylation. Subsequently, we searched for CpG sites with donor-specific variation in MSC preparations. These “epigenetic fingerprints” were highly enriched in non-promoter regions and outside of CpG islands – and they were maintained upon reprogramming into iP-MSC. In conclusion, DNA methylation profiles of iP-MSC clones from the same donor were closely related despite heterogeneity of MSC. On the other hand, iP-MSC maintain donor-derived epigenetic differences. In the absence of isogenic controls for disease modeling applications, it would therefore be more appropriate to compare iPSC from different donors rather than a high number of different clones from the same patient."
